              We like bells and whistles as much as the next person, but in the end,
              they just make noise. We're building Fluxx with everything you need to
              get your work done quickly - without all of the extra fluff.            
              <br />
              If it's in Fluxx, it's because it needs to be.

              Every great story has a great guide. Frodo had Gandolf, Luke had
              Yoda, Daniel had Mr. Miyagi... you get the picture. Fluxx is
              designed to lead you down the right path, help you when you need
              it, and guide you (and)

            <p>Your company needs visibility into what it's doing to make the
              right decisions, but doesn't always have the resources for a
              formal project management office. With Fluxx, you'll be able to
              take the first step toward organization and transparency without
              having to add another branch to your org chart.</p>
